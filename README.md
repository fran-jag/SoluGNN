# GCN Solubility Prediction

This project implements and deploys a **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** model for predicting solubility values of molecular compounds based on their **SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)** representations. This GCN architecture builds on graph-based representations of molecules to provide accurate predictions of solubility.

## Project Overview

### Objective
To create a robust GCN model capable of predicting solubility (e.g., solvation free energy) of chemical compounds by leveraging molecular graph representations. The project includes:
- Training and optimization using Bayesian techniques.
- Deployment for real-time predictions.

### Key Features

1. **Model Architecture**:
   - Implements GCN layers with graph convolutions and pooling operations.
   - Flexible hyperparameter tuning for layers, dropout, and learning rates.
   - Designed for scalable training on molecular datasets.

2. **Bayesian Optimization**:
   - Utilizes `Ax-platform` for Bayesian optimization.
   - Finds the optimal hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, learning rates) to minimize prediction error (RMSE).

3. **Prediction Service**:
   - Supports predictions using single or ensembles of models.
   - Generates outputs with associated uncertainty (mean and standard deviation for ensemble models).

4. **Molecular Data Handling**:
   - Converts SMILES strings to graph representations using **RDKit**.
   - Creates feature and adjacency matrices for GCN input.
